## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to produce a single, cohesive report where each analyst contributes analysis for a chapter based on their specific priority area.

**Published report:** [https://westofengland-ca.github.io/weca_regional_indicators/](https://westofengland-ca.github.io/weca_regional_indicators/)

## 📂 Repository Structure

We use a modular structure. Each chapter has its own directory to prevent file conflicts.

- `index.qmd`: The report landing page/executive summary.
- `_quarto.yml`: Global configuration (Chapter order, themes, and execution settings).
- `data/`: Shared data assets (Raw and Processed).
- `scripts/`: Shared utility scripts (Python/R functions used across chapters).
- **Chapters** (under `chapters/`):
  - `chapters/01-economy/`: Contributing to national economic growth (SN)
  - `chapters/02-transport/`: Connecting the region through better public transport (HB)
  - `chapters/03-place/`: Creating and building affordable/sustainable homes (CJ)
  - `chapters/04-skills/`: Empowering residents with future-ready skills (MJ)
  - `chapters/05-environment/`: Making the West of England the home for green jobs (SC)
  - `chapters/06-child-poverty/`: Lifting children and families out of poverty (MJ)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

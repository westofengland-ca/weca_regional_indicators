## Data Sources

| Source | URL / Location | Licence | Notes |
|--------|----------------|---------|-------|
| DESNZ local emissions | DESNZ LSOA emissions tables | OGL | Kt CO2e by sector |
| Renewable Energy Planning DB | BEIS/DESNZ REPD | OGL | Capacity in MW |
| DLUHC EPC register | DLUHC Open Data | OGL | Non-domestic certificates |

## Known Gaps and Caveats

- GHG emissions data has a ~2 year lag
- EPC data excludes properties not yet assessed
- Flood warning index is a proxy; does not reflect actual flood events

---

## Technical Dependencies

- R packages beyond `tidyverse`: `pins`, `gt`, `here`
- Data retrieved via `scripts/R/load_pins.R` (requires access to the WECA pins board)
- Python: none

---

## Refresh Process

1. Pull latest data from pins board: `source(here::here("scripts", "R", "load_pins.R"))`
2. Re-run the relevant indicator script in `scripts/R/05-environment/`
3. Fact table is written to `data/fact/` (committed)
4. Re-render chapter: `quarto render chapters/05-environment/index.qmd`
5. Commit updated freeze files and `data/fact/` outputs

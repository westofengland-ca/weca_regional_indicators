---

## 4️⃣ Visualizations

### ✅ Charts Are Well-Designed

- [ ] **Chart type suits the data**
  - Line charts for trends over time
  - Bar charts for comparisons
  - Maps for geographic patterns
  - Not misleading (e.g., broken axes justified)

- [ ] **Axes are labeled**
  - X-axis label (e.g., "Year")
  - Y-axis label with units (e.g., "Employment Rate (%)")
  - Labels are legible

- [ ] **Title is descriptive**
  - Explains what the chart shows
  - E.g., "Bus Ridership Trends in the West of England, 2015-2024"

- [ ] **Data source cited**
  - Caption includes source: "Source: Department for Transport"
  - Or footnote if multiple sources

- [ ] **Legend is clear (if needed)**
  - Colors/lines explained
  - Not cluttered (max 6-7 categories)

### ✅ WECA Branding Applied

- [ ] **Uses WECA color palette**
  - `theme_weca()` applied (R)
  - Or WECA colors used consistently (Python)

- [ ] **Fonts are readable**
  - Open Sans (body), Trebuchet (headings)
  - Minimum 9pt font size

- [ ] **Professional appearance**
  - Clean layout
  - No unnecessary gridlines
  - Appropriate white space

---

## 5️⃣ Accessibility

### ✅ Content Is Accessible

- [ ] **Alt text provided for all figures**

  ```r
  #| fig-cap: "Annual bus ridership showing 15% increase from 2015-2024"
  ```

  Describes what the chart shows, not just what it is

- [ ] **Color choices are colorblind-friendly**
  - Avoid red-green combinations alone
  - Use patterns or labels in addition to color
  - Test with colorblind simulator (e.g., [Coblis](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/))

- [ ] **Text contrast is sufficient**
  - Text on background meets WCAG AA standard (4.5:1 ratio)
  - Check with [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)

- [ ] **Charts work in grayscale**
  - Print preview or desaturate to check
  - Lines distinguishable by style (solid, dashed, dotted)

### ✅ Language Is Clear

- [ ] **Plain English used**
  - Technical terms defined on first use
  - Acronyms spelled out: "Office for National Statistics (ONS)"
  - Sentences are concise

- [ ] **Headings follow logical hierarchy**
  - `##` for main sections
  - `###` for subsections
  - No skipping levels (no `####` without `###`)

- [ ] **Tables are formatted clearly**
  - Column headers are descriptive
  - Numbers aligned right, text aligned left
  - Units in header (not repeated in every cell)

---

## 6️⃣ Code Quality

### ✅ Code Is Readable

- [ ] **No hardcoded file paths**
  - Uses relative paths from project root (R) or `pathlib.Path` (Python)
  - No `C:/Users/username/...`

- [ ] **Code is commented**
  - Complex logic explained
  - Why, not just what
  - E.g., `# Filter to 2020+ to exclude COVID-impacted baseline`

- [ ] **Variable names are descriptive**
  - `employment_rate` not `x`
  - `bus_ridership_data` not `df1`

- [ ] **Code chunks have labels**

  ```r
  #| label: load-employment-data
  ```

  Helps with debugging and cross-references

### ✅ Code Follows Style Guidelines

**R:**

- [ ] Uses `<-` for assignment (not `=`)
- [ ] snake_case for variables and functions
- [ ] Packages loaded at top of chunk

**Python:**

- [ ] Follows PEP 8 (check with `ruff`)
- [ ] Type hints where helpful
- [ ] Imports at top of chunk

**Both:**

- [ ] No commented-out code (remove or explain why kept)
- [ ] Consistent indentation (2 spaces for R, 4 for Python)

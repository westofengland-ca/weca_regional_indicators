# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository (`weca_regional_indicators`) contains the West of England Combined Authority (WECA) regional priorities report - a collaborative Quarto-based book where each analyst contributes a chapter.

**Published report:** [https://westofengland-ca.github.io/weca_regional_indicators/](https://westofengland-ca.github.io/weca_regional_indicators/)

## Architecture

### Repository Structure

Everything lives at the repository root (no nested `projects/` directory). Chapter directories under `chapters/` hold one per analyst/priority; shared data lives under `data/` (`raw/` and `processed/` are gitignored, `fact/` and `examples/` are committed); shared R code lives under `scripts/R/` (see [FACT Table Workflow](#fact-table-workflow) and [Chapter Setup](#chapter-setup) below for what each script provides).

### Quarto Report

**Tech Stack:**

- **Rendering:** Quarto
- **R:** Managed via `renv`
- **IDE:** Positron (recommended)

**Architecture Pattern:**

- **R-only:** All chapters use R; Python is not part of the toolchain
- **Modular:** Each chapter has its own directory to prevent merge conflicts
- **Freeze execution:** Chapters only re-render when source changes (`freeze: auto`)
- **Shared resources:** `data/` and `scripts/` directories contain assets used across chapters

**Chapter Structure:**
Each priority area has a dedicated chapter directory under `chapters/`:

- `chapters/01-economy/` - Contributing to national economic growth
- `chapters/02-transport/` - Better public transport connectivity
- `chapters/03-place/` - Affordable/sustainable homes
- `chapters/04-skills/` - Future-ready skills development
- `chapters/05-environment/` - Green jobs and growth
- `chapters/06-child-poverty/` - Lifting families out of poverty

## Working with the Report

### Adding a New Chapter

1. Create directory: `chapters/XX-topic-name/`
2. Add `index.qmd` file with Quarto frontmatter
3. Update `_quarto.yml` to include the chapter in sidebar navigation
4. Use `freeze: auto` to prevent re-rendering other chapters during development

### Code Display Settings

The report uses code folding to keep output clean:

- `code-fold: true` - Code is hidden by default
- `code-summary: "Show code"` - Toggle to reveal code blocks
- Set chunk options `message: false` and `warning: false` in code blocks

## Quarto Execution Model

**Key concept:** `freeze: auto` prevents R environment conflicts during final assembly. Chapters are cached and only re-executed when their source files change.

**Execution engine:**

- R chunks use the `renv` library (knitr engine)

## R Environment Setup

`.Rprofile` and `.Renviron` are committed to make the project portable across IDEs (RStudio, Positron, VS Code).

**Critical ordering:** `.Rprofile` activates `renv` first (`source("renv/activate.R")`), then loads vscode-R session watcher. If renv activates after `languageserver`/`httpgd` load, the wrong `rlang` namespace gets pinned for the session.

`.Renviron` sets `RENV_CONFIG_SYNCHRONIZED_CHECK=FALSE` to skip the per-startup lock-file sync (saves ~1.4 s). Run `renv::status()` manually when needed.

## FACT Table Workflow

The shared data contract for indicator observations. Each analyst writes their indicator's data to `data/fact/{indicator_id}.csv`; the report collates them at render time.

**Analyst steps (in every indicator script):**

```r
source(here::here("scripts", "R", "fact_helpers.R"))  # or via _common.R

# 1. Wrangle to exactly three columns: period_start, period_end, value
my_tbl <- raw_data |>
  transmute(
    period_start = as.Date(paste0(year, "-01-01")),
    period_end   = as.Date(paste0(year, "-12-31")),
    value        = my_metric
  )

# 2. Validate and stamp with indicator_id
fact_tbl <- build_fact(my_tbl, indicator_id = "RI_5_ghg_emissions")

# 3. Write to data/fact/RI_5_ghg_emissions.csv
save_fact(fact_tbl)
```

**At render time** (`_common.R` sources `collate_fact.R`):

```r
fact <- collate_fact()            # binds all data/fact/*.csv
rv   <- build_reporting_view(fact) # one row per indicator: latest, previous, sparkline

# Per-chapter GT summary table
# units/unit_type are looked up from core_dim_data_tbl by indicator_id
format_indicator_summary(rv, "RI_5_ghg_emissions", dim_tbl = core_dim_data_tbl, polarity = 1L)
```

**Rules enforced by `build_fact()`:** exactly `period_start`, `period_end`, `value` columns; no duplicate `period_end` per indicator; dates must coerce without NA; `period_start <= period_end`.

`polarity` (`format_indicator_summary()` arg, and a column on `core_dim_data_tbl`) marks whether an increase is good (`1`), bad (`-1`), or neutral (`0`) — it drives the up/down arrow colour in GT tables.

**Multi-indicator summary tables** (`dim_data.R` + `summary_tables.R`, both sourced by `_common.R`):

```r
# core_dim_data_tbl is loaded from data/common_project_data/indicators-master.xlsx
rv <- build_reporting_view(collate_fact())

# One row per indicator within a priority — chapter top-of-page summary
format_priority_summary(rv, core_dim_data_tbl, priority = 3)

# One table per priority, stacked — report landing page (index.qmd)
format_overall_summary(rv, core_dim_data_tbl)
```

Both go through one renderer, `.build_priority_gt()`, so a chapter's table is that priority's landing-page sub-table (green priority band, Change column, shared column widths) with a title and subtitle added. Change the renderer and both move together.

See [`docs/summary-table-units.md`](docs/summary-table-units.md) for how `units` and the change column handle percentages vs. percentage points.

**Sparkline note:** `format_indicator_summary()` generates SVG strings directly (not via `svglite`). Never use device rendering for inline GT sparklines — browsers fill `fill`-less polylines black.

## Chapter Setup

Every chapter sources `_common.R` which loads all shared helpers:

```r
source(here::here("scripts", "R", "_common.R"))
```

This provides: `theme_weca`, `load_csv()`, `build_fact()`, `save_fact()`, `collate_fact()`, `build_reporting_view()`, `format_indicator_summary()`, `core_dim_data_tbl`, `format_priority_summary()`, `format_overall_summary()`.

Each chapter directory also carries a `README.md` documenting its indicator table (ID, name, status, data source, refresh cadence) and known data gaps — see `chapters/03-place/README.md` for the pattern.

**Line and point sizing is set globally, not per chart.** `theme_weca()` (and so `theme_ua()`) carries `geom = element_geom(linewidth = weca_linewidth, pointsize = weca_pointsize)`, currently 1 and 2.5. Write `geom_line()` and `geom_point()` with no `linewidth` or `size` argument and they inherit those values, so every line chart in the report matches. Change the two constants at the top of `scripts/R/theme_weca.R` to restyle the whole report.

Set a size locally only where a layer must deviate — a lightweight reference line, for instance, needs `geom_hline(linewidth = 0.5)`, because otherwise it inherits the data-line weight and competes with it. An explicit argument always wins over the theme.

## Azure Blob Raw Data Sync

Raw chapter data (`data/raw/`) is not committed — it's synced from the central Azure Blob container. See the `sync-raw-data` skill for the commands and auth flow.

## R Documentation (btw MCP)

An MCP server for the `btw` R package is available. Use it when writing or reviewing R code in chapters:

- **`mcp__r-btw__btw_tool_docs_help_page`** — fetch full help pages (usage, arguments, examples) for any R function
- **`mcp__r-btw__btw_tool_docs_available_vignettes`** / **`btw_tool_docs_vignette`** — list and read package vignettes
- **`mcp__r-btw__btw_tool_docs_package_help_topics`** — list all topics in a package
- **`mcp__r-btw__list_r_sessions`** — inspect active R sessions (requires `mcptools::mcp_session()` running in R)

Use these tools instead of guessing R function signatures. Particularly valuable for ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, and other tidyverse packages used in chapters.

## Presentation Deck

`presentation/` is a separate Quarto project producing a revealjs deck of every chart in the book, one chart per slide. It is derived from the book — never authored alongside it. Full detail in [`docs/presentation.md`](docs/presentation.md).

```bash
cd presentation && quarto render      # writes presentation/_output/
```

**How content is derived** (`scripts/R/presentation_manifest.R`):

| Deck element | Comes from |
|---|---|
| Priority order and section titles | `_quarto.yml` chapter list, chapter YAML `title`/`subtitle` |
| Contents slide bullets | the `## Priority Areas` list in `index.qmd`, links retargeted at deck sections |
| Which charts appear, and their order | chart chunks in `chapters/*/index.qmd` |
| The chart image itself | the PNG the book already cached in `_freeze/` |
| Slide heading and alt text | the chunk's preceding `##` heading and its `fig-alt` |

**A chart chunk is any chunk carrying `fig-alt:`.** That is the whole rule. Add a chart to a chapter with alt text and it becomes a slide; no deck file needs touching. Chunks without `fig-alt` — GT summary tables, setup — are skipped, which is what keeps tables out of the deck. Two charts under one indicator are two chunks, so they get a slide each.

**Structure:** level-1 headings open one vertical stack per priority, with `navigation-mode: linear` so left/right steps through all 61 slides in reading order while the stacks still drive the overview grid (`o` key) and deep links.

Chart slides keep their `##` heading in the DOM for screen readers and the overview, but hide it visually (`.chart-slide` in `weca-reveal.scss`) — each plot already renders its own title, subtitle and source caption.

**The deck is never frozen** (`freeze: false`): it must always reflect the book's current `_freeze/`. If a chart chunk has no cached figure the render stops with an error naming the chunk — that means the book's freeze cache is stale and the book needs re-rendering first. For the same reason CI renders the book, then the deck, then copies `presentation/_output` into `_output/presentation` before publishing (see [Deployment](#deployment) below).

`presentation/figures/` is a gitignored copy of the cached PNGs plus `weca_logo.jpg`, refreshed on every render; Quarto cannot pull resources in from outside the presentation project.

**Data locations:**

- `data/` - Project data assets
- Raw data sources should be documented in chapter READMEs
- Processed data should be reproducible via documented scripts

## Output

Rendered reports are written to:

- `_output/` (configured in `_quarto.yml`)

This directory is gitignored - only source files are version controlled.

## Deployment

`.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs on every push to `main`. Two jobs:

- **`build`** — renders the book, then the presentation deck, copies the deck into `_output/presentation`, and uploads `_output/` as a Pages artefact (`actions/upload-pages-artifact`).
- **`deploy`** — publishes that artefact with `actions/deploy-pages`.

Pages is configured under Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions** (not the legacy "Deploy from a branch" build). The `gh-pages` branch is no longer written to and isn't part of the deploy path — it's dormant, kept around from the pre-migration setup rather than deleted outright.

**Setup (run once per clone):**

```bash
bash scripts/hooks/install-hooks.sh
```

**What the hook scans for:**

- `.env` files (blocked automatically)
- API keys (OpenAI, GitHub, AWS, Slack)
- Variable assignments containing passwords, tokens, credentials

**If a commit is blocked:**

1. Remove the secret from the file
2. Move credentials to environment variables or `.env` files (gitignored)
3. For false positives, update exclude patterns in `scripts/hooks/scan_secrets.sh`

## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues (`westofengland-ca/weca_regional_indicators`). See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

Five canonical roles mapped to default label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context layout — one `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/` at the repo root, per `docs/agents/domain.md`. Not yet created: check before assuming either exists.
